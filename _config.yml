# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: onKeyPress
# email: your-email@example.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A showcase of interesting debugging sessions and other technical writeups related to software development.
baseurl: "/blog" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://nevesnunes.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
github_username: nevesnunes

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
theme: minima
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-paginate

kramdown:
  footnote_backlink: '[return]'
paginate: 20

# > if you don't have header_pages set, minima will iterate over every page on the site seeing if it should add it to the header pages: in my case, it ultimately just picks http://about.md anyway, so the same effect just 100x slower. Since ~every page has a header, you get the O(n^2). Setting header_pages cut my build time down from 64 seconds to 4 seconds, even staying on Jekyll v3.9.
